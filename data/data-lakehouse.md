## Data lakehouse architecture

Data lakehouse architecture is a modern data management paradigm that combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses to provide a unified and versatile data platform. It addresses the limitations of both traditional data warehouses and data lakes, offering a more efficient, scalable, and flexible solution for managing and analyzing large volumes of data. Here's a detailed explanation of the data lakehouse architecture:

### Key Concepts

1. Unified Data Storage: 
   - The lakehouse combines the raw data storage capabilities of data lakes with the structured and optimized storage of data warehouses. 
   - It stores data in its native format (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) in a centralized repository, typically on cloud-based object storage.

2. Support for Multiple Data Types:
   - It can handle diverse data types, including text, images, videos, and structured tabular data.
   - Supports a variety of data processing and analysis tasks, such as batch processing, real-time analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.

3. Scalability and Performance:
   - Leverages the scalability of data lakes, enabling the storage of petabytes of data at a low cost.
   - Implements indexing, caching, and query optimization techniques to provide fast query performance comparable to data warehouses.

4. ACID Transactions:
   - Ensures data consistency and reliability by supporting ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.
   - This is crucial for maintaining data integrity during concurrent data updates and reads.

5. Schema Enforcement and Evolution:
   - Supports schema enforcement, allowing for structured data to be validated against predefined schemas.
   - Facilitates schema evolution, enabling the addition of new fields or modifications to existing schemas without disrupting ongoing operations.

6. Governance and Security:
   - Integrates robust data governance frameworks, including data lineage, auditing, and access controls.
   - Ensures data security through encryption, role-based access controls, and compliance with data privacy regulations.

### Architecture Components

1. Storage Layer:
   - Centralized storage, typically cloud-based, where raw and processed data is stored.
   - Examples include Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.

2. Metadata Layer:
   - Manages metadata, including schemas, data locations, and statistics.
   - Implements data catalogs and indexing to enable efficient data discovery and query optimization.
   - Examples include Apache Hive Metastore and AWS Glue


## Hudi, Iceberg, and Delta Lake

Hudi, Iceberg, and Delta Lake are three prominent open-source data lakehouse solutions that provide advanced features for managing large-scale data in data lakes. Each of these technologies addresses the limitations of traditional data lakes by introducing capabilities like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel. Here's a detailed explanation and comparison of these three technologies:

### 1. Apache Hudi (Hadoop Upsert Delete and Incremental)

Apache Hudi is an open-source data management framework that provides the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in data lakes. It is designed to integrate with the Hadoop ecosystem and provides efficient data ingestion and processing capabilities.

Key Features:
- ACID Transactions: Supports atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable transactions, ensuring data integrity.
- Incremental Processing: Allows for efficient incremental data ingestion and updates.
- Data Versioning: Maintains historical versions of data, enabling time travel queries.
- Upserts and Deletes: Supports upsert and delete operations, which are essential for handling change data capture (CDC) scenarios.
- Indexing: Provides indexing to speed up data retrieval and avoid full table scans.

Architecture:
- Storage Types: Supports different storage types like Copy-on-Write (CoW) and Merge-on-Read (MoR) to balance between read and write performance.
- Integration: Integrates with Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache Hive for data processing and querying.

Use Cases:
- Real-time analytics and dashboards.
- Data lake consolidation with incremental data ingestion.
- ETL workflows with CDC.

### 2. Apache Iceberg

Overview:
Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. It is designed to address the challenges of managing petabyte-scale tables, ensuring high performance, reliability, and ease of use for data lake storage.

Key Features:
- ACID Transactions: Ensures data consistency with support for atomic operations.
- Schema Evolution: Allows for schema changes without needing to rewrite the entire table.
- Partitioning: Supports advanced partitioning techniques, making it efficient to query large datasets.
- Snapshot Isolation: Provides snapshot isolation for reads, enabling time travel queries.
- Hidden Partitioning: Manages partitions automatically without exposing them to the user, simplifying the user experience.

Architecture:
- File Formats: Supports multiple file formats including Parquet, Avro, and ORC.
- Integration: Integrates with various compute engines such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Presto, and Trino.

Use Cases:
- Large-scale analytics and BI reporting.
- Data warehousing on data lakes.
- Simplified management of data lake storage with advanced partitioning.

### 3. Delta Lake

Overview:
Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. It provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing.

Key Features:
- ACID Transactions: Ensures reliable and consistent data operations with ACID compliance.
- Unified Batch and Streaming: Supports both batch and streaming data processing in a unified manner.
- Schema Enforcement and Evolution: Enforces schemas and allows for schema evolution without requiring table rewrites.
- Time Travel: Enables querying historical versions of data using time travel.
- Scalable Metadata: Handles metadata at scale, enabling efficient queries on large datasets.

Architecture:
- Delta Log: Maintains a transaction log (Delta Log) to keep track of changes and ensure ACID properties.
- File Formats: Typically uses Parquet as the underlying file format.
- Integration: Deep integration with Apache Spark, making it a popular choice for Spark-based workloads.

Use Cases:
- Reliable data pipelines with robust ETL processes.
- Real-time data analytics and ML workloads.
- Managing slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) and CDC.
