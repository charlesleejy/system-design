## How hadoop works

Hereâ€™s a detailed point-by-point explanation of how Hadoop works:

### 1. Introduction to Hadoop

- Hadoop is an open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets using the MapReduce programming model.
- It consists of two main components:
  - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): A distributed file system for storing data.
  - MapReduce: A processing model for large-scale data processing.

### 2. Hadoop Architecture

- Cluster Setup: Hadoop runs on a cluster of machines, typically comprising many nodes.
  - Master Nodes: Include NameNode (for HDFS) and JobTracker (for MapReduce).
  - Slave Nodes: Include DataNodes (for HDFS) and TaskTrackers (for MapReduce).

### 3. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

- NameNode:
  - Manages the metadata of the filesystem (e.g., directory structure, file-to-block mapping).
  - Keeps track of all the files and blocks in the HDFS.
  - Responsible for namespace operations like opening, closing, and renaming files and directories.

- DataNode:
  - Stores the actual data blocks.
  - Reports the list of blocks it is storing to the NameNode periodically.
  - Handles read and write requests from the clients.

- Replication:
  - HDFS splits files into blocks (default 128MB) and stores them redundantly across multiple DataNodes (default replication factor is 3).
  - Ensures fault tolerance and high availability.

### 4. MapReduce Framework

- JobTracker:
  - Resides on the master node.
  - Manages the distribution and execution of MapReduce jobs.
  - Keeps track of all TaskTrackers and the progress of tasks.

- TaskTracker:
  - Resides on slave nodes.
  - Executes individual map and reduce tasks as directed by the JobTracker.
  - Periodically sends progress reports to the JobTracker.

### 5. Data Processing Workflow

Step-by-Step Workflow:

1. Data Ingestion:
   - Data is ingested into HDFS using tools like `Hadoop fs`, Flume, or Sqoop.
   - Data is split into blocks and distributed across DataNodes.

2. Job Submission:
   - A client submits a MapReduce job to the JobTracker.
   - The job includes the map and reduce functions, input/output paths, and configuration parameters.

3. Job Initialization:
   - The JobTracker splits the job into map and reduce tasks.
   - It schedules these tasks on available TaskTrackers, considering data locality to minimize network congestion.

4. Map Phase:
   - Each TaskTracker executes map tasks on the input data blocks.
   - The map function processes input key-value pairs to generate intermediate key-value pairs.
   - Intermediate data is sorted and partitioned by key before being written to the local disk.

5. Shuffle and Sort Phase:
   - Intermediate data is transferred (shuffled) from map tasks to reduce tasks.
   - Data is sorted by key on the reducer side.

6. Reduce Phase:
   - Each TaskTracker executes reduce tasks on the shuffled intermediate data.
   - The reduce function aggregates intermediate values associated with the same key.
   - The final output is written to HDFS.

7. Job Completion:
   - The JobTracker monitors the progress and completion of tasks.
   - Once all tasks are complete, the JobTracker notifies the client and updates the job status.

### 6. Fault Tolerance

- DataNode Failures:
  - The NameNode detects DataNode failures through regular heartbeat signals.
  - It re-replicates blocks stored on failed DataNodes to other healthy nodes to maintain the replication factor.
- TaskTracker Failures:
  - The JobTracker detects TaskTracker failures through heartbeat signals.
  - It reschedules failed map and reduce tasks on other healthy TaskTrackers.
- NameNode Failures:
  - As the NameNode is a single point of failure, Hadoop supports a secondary NameNode for checkpointing (but not a direct replacement).
  - High Availability (HA) configurations involve multiple NameNodes with failover mechanisms.

### 7. Scalability

- Hadoop can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- It efficiently handles increased data volume and workload by distributing data and processing across the additional nodes.

### 8. Ecosystem Integration

- Hadoop integrates with a variety of tools in its ecosystem:
  - Pig: A high-level scripting language for data processing.
  - Hive: A data warehouse infrastructure that provides SQL-like querying.
  - HBase: A distributed, scalable NoSQL database.
  - Oozie: A workflow scheduler for managing Hadoop jobs.
  - Spark: An in-memory data processing engine that works with HDFS.

### 9. Use Cases

- Hadoop is widely used for:
  - Big Data Analytics: Processing large datasets to extract insights.
  - Data Warehousing: Storing and querying large volumes of structured and semi-structured data.
  - Machine Learning: Training models on large datasets.
  - Log Processing: Analyzing large volumes of log data from various sources.

By leveraging HDFS for scalable storage and MapReduce for parallel data processing, Hadoop provides a robust framework for managing and analyzing big data.


Explain mapreduce in point form

Sure, here's an explanation of MapReduce in point form, along with an example:

### Map Phase:
- Input Splitting: The input data is split into manageable chunks.
- Mapping: Each chunk is processed by a map function which transforms the input data into key-value pairs.
- Intermediate Data: The map function generates intermediate key-value pairs.

Example: Word Count
- Input Data: 
  ```
  "Hello world"
  "Hello Hadoop"
  ```
- Splitting: Two chunks:
  - Chunk 1: "Hello world"
  - Chunk 2: "Hello Hadoop"

- Mapping: Each line is processed to create key-value pairs (word, 1):
  - Chunk 1: ("Hello", 1), ("world", 1)
  - Chunk 2: ("Hello", 1), ("Hadoop", 1)

### Shuffle and Sort Phase:
- Grouping: The intermediate key-value pairs are grouped by key.
- Sorting: The grouped key-value pairs are sorted by key to facilitate efficient processing in the reduce phase.

Example:
- Intermediate Pairs:
  - ("Hello", 1), ("world", 1), ("Hello", 1), ("Hadoop", 1)
- Grouped and Sorted:
  - ("Hello", [1, 1])
  - ("world", [1])
  - ("Hadoop", [1])

### Reduce Phase:
- Reducing: The reduce function processes each group of key-value pairs to produce a final output. This involves aggregating or summarizing the data.
- Output: The reduce function generates the final key-value pairs which are then written to the output.

Example:
- Reducing:
  - "Hello": sum([1, 1]) = 2
  - "world": sum([1]) = 1
  - "Hadoop": sum([1]) = 1
- Output:
  - ("Hello", 2)
  - ("world", 1)
  - ("Hadoop", 1)

### Additional Points:
- Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale data processing across distributed systems.
- Fault Tolerance: Built-in mechanisms to handle node failures.
- Parallel Processing: Executes tasks in parallel to speed up processing.
- Data Locality: Optimizes processing by moving computation to the location of data.
- Frameworks: Commonly implemented in frameworks like Hadoop.

This example illustrates how MapReduce processes input data to count the occurrences of each word in a dataset.


## HBase


Here's a detailed point-by-point explanation of how HBase works:

### 1. Introduction to HBase

- HBase is a distributed, scalable, NoSQL database built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
- It is designed to provide random, real-time read/write access to large datasets.

### 2. HBase Architecture

- Master-Slave Architecture:
  - HBase Master: Manages the cluster, coordinates load balancing and schema changes.
  - RegionServers: Handle read and write requests for the tables and manage regions (subsets of tables).

### 3. Data Model

- Tables: HBase stores data in tables.
- Rows: Each table consists of rows identified by a unique row key.
- Column Families: Each row can have one or more column families.
- Columns: Columns are grouped into column families and are referenced as `family:qualifier`.
- Cells: The intersection of a row and column (within a column family) forms a cell, which stores the data.
- Timestamps: Each cell value is versioned by a timestamp.

### 4. HBase Components

- HBase Master:
  - Assigns regions to RegionServers.
  - Handles schema changes and manages metadata operations.
  - Coordinates load balancing and recovery of failed RegionServers.
- RegionServer:
  - Manages regions and handles read/write requests.
  - Communicates with the HDFS for storage operations.
- Zookeeper:
  - Provides distributed coordination and maintains server state information.
  - Helps in tracking region servers, HBase Master, and providing ephemeral nodes.

### 5. Data Storage

- Regions:
  - A region is a subset of a table's data, defined by a range of row keys.
  - Regions are dynamically split when they become too large and reassigned by the HBase Master.
- Store and StoreFiles:
  - Each column family has its own store.
  - Data within a store is saved in StoreFiles, which are HDFS files (HFiles).
- MemStore:
  - An in-memory write buffer for each column family.
  - Data is initially written to the MemStore before being flushed to HFiles.
- HFile:
  - The on-disk storage format for data in HBase.
  - Immutable and stored in HDFS.

### 6. Data Operations

Write Operations:
1. Client Request:
   - A client sends a write request to the HBase.
2. Write-Ahead Log (WAL):
   - The write is first recorded in the WAL to ensure durability.
3. MemStore:
   - The data is then written to the MemStore.
4. Flush to HFile:
   - When the MemStore reaches a certain size, data is flushed to HFile on HDFS.

Read Operations:
1. Client Request:
   - A client sends a read request to the HBase.
2. MemStore:
   - The RegionServer first checks the MemStore for the requested data.
3. BlockCache:
   - If not found in MemStore, it checks the BlockCache (in-memory cache).
4. HFile:
   - If not found in BlockCache, it reads from the HFile on HDFS.

### 7. Compactions

- Minor Compaction:
  - Combines smaller HFiles into larger HFiles to reduce the number of files and improve read performance.
- Major Compaction:
  - Combines all HFiles for a column family into a single HFile, discarding deleted and outdated data.

### 8. Region Management

- Region Assignment:
  - The HBase Master assigns regions to RegionServers.
- Region Splitting:
  - Regions split automatically when they grow too large.
  - Split regions are re-assigned to RegionServers by the HBase Master.
- Region Merging:
  - Small regions can be merged to optimize storage and performance.

### 9. Zookeeper Coordination

- Server Tracking:
  - Keeps track of HBase Master and RegionServer statuses.
- Failure Detection:
  - Detects failures and helps in re-assigning regions from failed RegionServers.
- Ephemeral Nodes:
  - Uses ephemeral nodes for dynamic server management.

### 10. Fault Tolerance and High Availability

- Data Redundancy:
  - HBase relies on HDFS for data storage, leveraging its replication for fault tolerance.
- WAL:
  - Ensures data durability by logging changes before they are applied to the MemStore.
- Automatic Failover:
  - Zookeeper detects server failures and facilitates automatic failover and recovery.

### 11. Use Cases

- Real-time Analytics:
  - Provides real-time read/write access, making it suitable for analytics applications.
- Time-Series Data:
  - Efficiently handles large volumes of time-series data with high write throughput.
- Sparse Data:
  - Handles sparse datasets effectively with its flexible schema design.

### 12. Integration with Hadoop Ecosystem

- Hadoop:
  - Natively integrated with Hadoop for scalable storage.
- MapReduce:
  - Can be used as a source and sink for MapReduce jobs.
- Hive:
  - Integration with Hive for SQL-like querying.
- Pig:
  - Can be used with Pig for data processing scripts.

### 13. HBase Shell

- Interactive Shell:
  - Provides commands for creating tables, adding data, and performing administrative tasks.
  - Example Commands:
    ```shell
    create 'mytable', 'mycf'
    put 'mytable', 'row1', 'mycf:col1', 'value1'
    get 'mytable', 'row1'
    scan 'mytable'
    ```

### Summary

HBase, as a distributed NoSQL database, provides scalable and real-time read/write access to big data. With its architecture of HBase Master, RegionServers, and Zookeeper, HBase efficiently manages data through regions, MemStores, and HFiles. It ensures fault tolerance and high availability by leveraging HDFS and WAL. HBase is well-suited for real-time analytics, time-series data, and sparse datasets, integrating seamlessly with the Hadoop ecosystem.



## Cloudera HDFS

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data. HDFS is a key part of many big data solutions and is designed to be highly fault-tolerant by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster. Cloudera's distribution of Hadoop, often known as CDH (Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), includes HDFS.

Core Components of HDFS:
Â 
NameNode: The NameNode is the master node that manages the filesystem metadata, i.e., the data about the data. It knows the directory tree of all files in the system, and tracks where across the cluster the file data is kept. There is only one NameNode per Hadoop cluster.
Â 
DataNodes: These are the worker nodes that store the actual data. DataNodes report to the NameNode with the list of blocks they are storing. There can be one or multiple DataNodes in a Hadoop cluster.
Â 
Block: HDFS breaks up input data into blocks, each typically 128 MB or 256 MB in size, and distributes these blocks amongst different nodes in the cluster. Each block is independently replicated at multiple DataNodes to ensure fault tolerance.
Â 
How HDFS Works:
Â 
When a file is placed into HDFS, it gets broken down into large blocks, and each block is stored on one or more DataNodes. This distribution allows for data redundancy and supports the processing of data across a cluster of servers.
Â 
For instance, consider a large file of 512 MB. If we assume a block size of 128 MB, the file will be split into four blocks. These blocks are distributed across different DataNodes based on factors like available space, the location of the DataNode, and the replication factor. The latter is a property that dictates the number of replicas to be maintained for each block, with the default typically set to 3.
Â 
When a client wants to read a file, it communicates with the NameNode to determine which blocks make up the file and the locations of those blocks. The client then reads block data directly from the DataNode servers.
Â 
If a client wants to write or append data, the client asks the NameNode to nominate three DataNodes to host replicas of the first block of the file. The client then writes data to these DataNodes in a pipeline fashion.

Example:
Â 
Let's consider a scenario where we want to process a large text file (512 MB) using HDFS.
Â 
Write Operation:
* The large text file is divided into blocks, assuming block size of 128 MB, the file will be divided into four blocks.
* Each of these blocks is then replicated across different DataNodes based on the replication factor (say, 3). The NameNode keeps the metadata about these blocks' location.
Â 
Read Operation:
* When a client wants to read the file, it asks the NameNode for the blocks' location.
* The NameNode returns the addresses of DataNodes that contain these blocks.
* The client then directly contacts these DataNodes to read the data blocks.
Â 
HDFS is designed to work this way to support batch processing rather than interactive use by users. The benefits of this design are that data locality can be leveraged to reduce network I/O, and that it can scale to a very large size - thousands of nodes, millions of blocks, and petabytes of data.
