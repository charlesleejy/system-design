## Data serialisation, CPU time and wait time

### Data Serialization

#### Definition
Data serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and later reconstructed. In the context of databases and query execution, serialization is crucial for sending data between different components of a distributed system or for persisting data to disk.

#### Common Serialization Formats
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**
- **Protobuf (Protocol Buffers)**
- **Avro**

#### Use Cases in Databases
1. **Data Transfer**: Moving data between client and server, or between different servers.
2. **Caching**: Storing objects in a cache in a serialized form.
3. **Logging**: Persisting objects in logs for auditing and debugging.
4. **Persistence**: Storing objects in databases or file systems.

#### Example
When a query result set is sent from a database server to a client application, it may be serialized into JSON format:
```json
[
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
]
```

### CPU Time in Query Execution Plan

#### Definition
CPU time in a query execution plan refers to the amount of time the processor spends executing the instructions of the query. It includes time spent on:
- Parsing the query
- Optimizing the query
- Executing the operations required to fulfill the query (e.g., joins, aggregations)

#### Importance
- **Performance Analysis**: High CPU time can indicate that the query is complex or inefficient.
- **Resource Management**: Helps in understanding the load on the CPU and planning resource allocation.
- **Optimization**: Identifying operations that consume significant CPU time can guide efforts to optimize queries.

#### Example
In a SQL query execution plan, you might see something like:
```
Node Type: Aggregate
  CPU Time: 25ms
  Details: ...
```
This indicates that the aggregate operation took 25 milliseconds of CPU time.

### Waiting Time in Query Execution Plan

#### Definition
Waiting time, also known as wait time, in a query execution plan refers to the time spent waiting for resources to become available. This can include waiting for:
- I/O operations to complete (e.g., reading data from disk)
- Locks to be released by other transactions
- Network latency in distributed systems

#### Importance
- **Bottleneck Identification**: High waiting times can indicate resource contention or I/O bottlenecks.
- **Concurrency Management**: Helps in understanding the impact of concurrent transactions on query performance.
- **System Tuning**: Provides insights for tuning the system to reduce wait times, such as optimizing disk I/O, improving indexing, or reducing lock contention.

#### Example
In a SQL query execution plan, you might see something like:
```
Node Type: Index Scan
  Waiting Time: 45ms
  Details: ...
```
This indicates that the index scan operation spent 45 milliseconds waiting for resources.

### Understanding the Execution Plan

A query execution plan is a detailed map of how a database engine executes a query. It includes information about various operations involved in query execution, such as joins, scans, aggregations, and sorts. It also provides metrics like CPU time, waiting time, and memory usage, which are crucial for performance analysis and optimization.

#### Components of an Execution Plan

1. **Operation Nodes**: Represent different operations like scans, joins, sorts, etc.
2. **Cost Metrics**: Include CPU time, waiting time, and I/O operations.
3. **Row Estimates**: Number of rows processed at each stage.
4. **Order of Execution**: The sequence in which operations are performed.

#### Example of an Execution Plan

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT customer.name, SUM(order.amount)
FROM customer
JOIN order ON customer.id = order.customer_id
GROUP BY customer.name;
```

Example Execution Plan:
```
HashAggregate (cost=500.75..502.75 rows=100 width=48) (actual time=40.905..40.913 rows=100 loops=1)
  Group Key: customer.name
  ->  Hash Join (cost=200.50..480.25 rows=5000 width=48) (actual time=10.605..30.403 rows=5000 loops=1)
        Hash Cond: (order.customer_id = customer.id)
        ->  Seq Scan on order (cost=0.00..150.00 rows=10000 width=20) (actual time=0.007..10.007 rows=10000 loops=1)
        ->  Hash (cost=150.00..150.00 rows=5000 width=20) (actual time=10.581..10.581 rows=5000 loops=1)
              ->  Seq Scan on customer (cost=0.00..150.00 rows=5000 width=20) (actual time=0.005..5.005 rows=5000 loops=1)
Planning Time: 1.123 ms
Execution Time: 42.543 ms
```

In this plan:
- **HashAggregate** node has a cost and actual time metrics.
- **Hash Join** operation has both CPU time (actual time) and the number of rows processed.
- **Seq Scan** on `order` and `customer` tables shows the actual time taken and the number of rows scanned.

### Conclusion

Understanding data serialization, CPU time, and waiting time in query execution plans is essential for optimizing database performance. Serialization facilitates efficient data transfer and storage, CPU time highlights computational costs, and waiting time reveals resource contention. Together, these metrics help identify performance bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts, ensuring efficient query execution and better resource utilization.
