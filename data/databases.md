### Advanced Database Concepts

#### 1. Normalization
   - Definition: Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy.
   - Forms:
     - 1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures each column contains atomic values.
     - 2NF (Second Normal Form): Achieves 1NF and ensures no partial dependency of any column on the primary key.
     - 3NF (Third Normal Form): Achieves 2NF and ensures no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.

### How B-Tree Works

Definition:
- A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

### Key Characteristics

1. Balanced Tree:
   - Ensures that the tree remains balanced, with all leaf nodes at the same depth.
   - Maintains a low height by allowing nodes to have multiple children.

2. Nodes and Keys:
   - Each node contains multiple keys and children pointers.
   - Keys within a node are stored in sorted order.

3. Degree (Order):
   - Minimum degree `t` (also known as the order) determines the range for the number of keys.
   - Each node (except root) must have at least `t-1` keys and at most `2t-1` keys.

4. Root Node:
   - The root node can have a minimum of 1 key if it has children.
   - If the root node has no children, it can be empty.

5. Internal and Leaf Nodes:
   - Internal Nodes: Contain keys and pointers to child nodes.
   - Leaf Nodes: Contain keys but no children, serving as the endpoint for searches.

### Operations

1. Search:
   - Start from the root node and compare the target key with the keys in the node.
   - Traverse the child pointers based on the comparison until the key is found or a leaf node is reached.
   - Complexity: O(log n) where `n` is the number of keys.

2. Insertion:
   - Insert the key into the appropriate leaf node while maintaining the sorted order.
   - If the leaf node overflows (contains more than `2t-1` keys), split the node:
     - Middle key moves up to the parent node.
     - Split the remaining keys into two nodes.
   - Repeat the process up to the root if necessary, potentially increasing the tree height.
   - Complexity: O(log n) for search + O(log n) for potential splits.

3. Deletion:
   - Remove the key from the node.
   - If the node underflows (contains fewer than `t-1` keys), handle the deficiency:
     - Borrowing: Borrow a key from a sibling node.
     - Merging: Merge the node with a sibling if borrowing is not possible.
   - If the root node is the only node left and it becomes empty, remove it, reducing the tree height.
   - Complexity: O(log n) for search + O(log n) for potential rebalancing.

4. Balancing:
   - B-trees maintain balance by ensuring all leaf nodes are at the same depth.
   - The tree adjusts dynamically during insertion and deletion to remain balanced.

### Structure

1. Node Structure:
   - Each node contains a set of keys `[k1, k2, ..., kn]` and pointers to child nodes `[p0, p1, ..., pn]`.
   - Keys are maintained in a sorted order.

2. Properties:
   - Each internal node with `n` keys has `n+1` children.
   - The keys in the node act as separation values that divide the range of values in the children.

### Example

1. Insertion Example:
   - Insert `20` into the tree.
   - Locate the appropriate position and insert `20` in the leaf node.
   - If the node exceeds the maximum number of keys, split it and propagate the middle key upwards.

2. Deletion Example:
   - Delete `15` from the tree.
   - Locate `15` and remove it.
   - If the node underflows, borrow from a sibling or merge nodes as necessary.

### Advantages

1. Efficiency:
   - Maintains logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
2. Balanced:
   - Ensures all leaf nodes are at the same depth, maintaining balance.
3. Optimized Disk Access:
   - Suitable for databases and file systems where read/write operations are expensive.

### Disadvantages

1. Complexity:
   - More complex to implement compared to simpler data structures.
2. Space Overhead:
   - Requires additional space for child pointers and maintaining balance.

### Use Cases

   - Widely used in relational databases to index data for efficient retrieval.
2. File Systems:
