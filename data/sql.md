## Execution steps of an SQL query:

### 1. Parsing
- **Lexical Analysis**: The SQL query string is divided into tokens. Keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals are identified.
- **Syntax Analysis**: The sequence of tokens is checked against the SQL grammar rules. If the syntax is correct, a parse tree is generated; otherwise, an error is returned.

### 2. Query Rewrite
- **View Resolution**: If the query involves views, the views are replaced with their definitions.
- **Subquery Flattening**: Subqueries are transformed into joins if possible, to simplify the query.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Conditions are pushed down to reduce the amount of data processed early in the query execution.

### 3. Optimization
- **Logical Optimization**: The query is transformed into an equivalent but more efficient form. This can involve reordering joins, eliminating unnecessary joins, and simplifying expressions.
- **Cost Estimation**: The query optimizer estimates the cost of different query execution plans based on factors like the number of rows, index availability, and data distribution.
- **Physical Optimization**: The optimizer selects the best physical execution plan. This includes choosing the best algorithms for joins (e.g., nested loop join, hash join), the best indexes to use, and the order in which to access the tables.

### 4. Execution Plan Generation
- **Plan Compilation**: The chosen execution plan is compiled into a sequence of low-level operations.
- **Query Plan Cache**: The execution plan might be cached for reuse if the same query is executed frequently.

### 5. Execution
- **Access Methods**: Data is retrieved from tables and indexes according to the execution plan.
- **Join Processing**: Tables are joined based on the join algorithm selected by the optimizer.
- **Predicate Evaluation**: Conditions in the WHERE clause are applied to filter rows.
- **Aggregation and Sorting**: Operations like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions are performed as needed.
- **Projection**: The final set of columns specified in the SELECT clause is produced.
- **Result Return**: The result set is returned to the client.

### Example
Let's consider a simple query to illustrate these steps:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000
ORDER BY e.name;
```

1. **Parsing**: The query is tokenized and parsed into a parse tree.
2. **Query Rewrite**: No views or subqueries to resolve. The WHERE condition might be analyzed for predicate pushdown.
3. **Optimization**:
   - **Logical Optimization**: The optimizer might decide that filtering by salary (`e.salary > 50000`) should be done before the join to reduce the number of rows processed.
   - **Cost Estimation**: The optimizer estimates the cost of joining `employees` and `departments` based on available indexes and statistics.
   - **Physical Optimization**: The optimizer chooses a hash join or nested loop join based on cost estimates.
4. **Execution Plan Generation**: The chosen plan is compiled into a series of operations.
5. **Execution**:
   - **Access Methods**: Rows from the `employees` table are fetched where `salary > 50000`.
   - **Join Processing**: The filtered `employees` rows are joined with `departments` using the chosen join algorithm.
   - **Predicate Evaluation**: Only rows matching the join condition (`e.department_id = d.department_id`) are processed.
   - **Aggregation and Sorting**: The results are sorted by `e.name`.
   - **Projection**: The final result set includes `e.name` and `d.department_name`.
   - **Result Return**: The result set is sent to the client.

By understanding these steps, you can gain deeper insight into how SQL queries are processed and how to optimize them for better performance.


## Explain in terms of SQL query what is the order of execution 

In SQL, the order of execution of a query follows a specific logical sequence, although it may not always correspond to the order in which the clauses are written in the query. Here's a detailed explanation of the logical order of execution for a typical SQL query:

1. **FROM clause**: This clause identifies the tables from which to retrieve the data. If there are joins, this step includes joining tables together.
   ```sql
   FROM table_name
   ```

2. **WHERE clause**: This clause filters the rows based on a condition before any grouping occurs.
   ```sql
   WHERE condition
   ```

3. **GROUP BY clause**: This clause groups the filtered rows into summary rows by the specified columns.
   ```sql
   GROUP BY column_name
   ```

4. **HAVING clause**: This clause applies a condition to the groups created by the GROUP BY clause, filtering out groups that do not meet the criteria.
   ```sql
   HAVING condition
   ```

5. **SELECT clause**: This clause specifies the columns to be returned by the query, including any aggregate functions.
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   ```

6. **DISTINCT clause**: This clause removes duplicate rows from the result set.
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT column_name(s)
   ```

7. **ORDER BY clause**: This clause sorts the result set by one or more columns.
   ```sql
   ORDER BY column_name(s)
   ```

8. **LIMIT clause**: This clause restricts the number of rows returned by the query.
   ```sql
   LIMIT number
   ```

Here's a practical example to illustrate:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM table1
WHERE column3 = 'value'
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY column1
LIMIT 10;
```

In this example, the execution order would be:

1. **FROM table1**: Identify the table to query.
2. **WHERE column3 = 'value'**: Filter rows where column3 equals 'value'.
3. **GROUP BY column1, column2**: Group the filtered rows by column1 and column2.
4. **HAVING COUNT(*) > 1**: Filter groups to include only those with a count greater than 1.
5. **SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, COUNT(*)**: Select distinct values of column1 and column2, along with the count of rows in each group.
6. **ORDER BY column1**: Sort the result set by column1.
7. **LIMIT 10**: Return only the first 10 rows of the result set.

Understanding this logical order helps in writing efficient and accurate SQL queries.


Explain in technical detail how distinct work in sql


In SQL, the `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set of a query. Here's a detailed explanation of how `DISTINCT` works technically:

### SQL Query Structure with DISTINCT
When you use `DISTINCT`, it affects the rows returned by the `SELECT` statement by ensuring that each row is unique. The syntax looks like this:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Execution Steps

1. **SELECT Clause Execution**:
   - When the SQL engine encounters the `DISTINCT` keyword, it processes the `SELECT` clause to identify the columns that need to be included in the result set.

2. **FROM Clause Execution**:
   - The engine retrieves data from the specified table(s) and performs any necessary joins as specified in the `FROM` clause.

3. **WHERE Clause Execution**:
   - The engine applies the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the given condition before any further processing.

4. **Result Set Construction**:
   - After filtering, the engine constructs a temporary result set that includes all columns specified in the `SELECT` clause but without yet applying `DISTINCT`.

5. **Distinct Processing**:
   - The engine now evaluates the temporary result set to remove duplicate rows. This process involves:
     - **Sorting**: The engine may sort the rows based on the columns specified in the `SELECT DISTINCT` clause to facilitate easy identification of duplicates.
     - **Comparison**: The engine compares each row with the previous one (or uses a hashing mechanism) to detect duplicates.
     - **Elimination**: Duplicate rows are eliminated, ensuring that only unique rows remain in the final result set.

### Internal Mechanisms

1. **Sorting-Based Method**:
   - **Step 1**: The engine sorts the result set by all columns specified in the `SELECT DISTINCT` clause.
   - **Step 2**: It then scans through the sorted data, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique combination of column values and discarding any subsequent duplicates.

2. **Hashing-Based Method**:
   - **Step 1**: The engine computes a hash value for each row based on the columns specified.
   - **Step 2**: It uses a hash table to track seen rows. Each new row's hash is checked against the hash table.
   - **Step 3**: If the hash is found in the table (indicating a duplicate), the row is discarded; otherwise, the row is added to the hash table and included in the result set.

### Example

Consider the following table `employees`:

| id | name   | department |
|----|--------|------------|
| 1  | Alice  | HR         |
| 2  | Bob    | IT         |
| 3  | Alice  | HR         |
| 4  | Charlie| IT         |

Running the query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, department FROM employees;
```

### Execution Steps:

1. **SELECT Clause**: Identify columns `name` and `department`.
2. **FROM Clause**: Retrieve rows from `employees`.
3. **WHERE Clause**: No condition, so all rows are considered.
4. **Temporary Result Set**:

   | name    | department |
   |---------|------------|
   | Alice   | HR         |
   | Bob     | IT         |
   | Alice   | HR         |
   | Charlie | IT         |

5. **Distinct Processing** (e.g., Sorting-Based):

   - Sort rows:
     | name    | department |
     |---------|------------|
     | Alice   | HR         |
     | Alice   | HR         |
     | Bob     | IT         |
     | Charlie | IT         |
   
   - Remove duplicates:
     | name    | department |
     |---------|------------|
     | Alice   | HR         |
     | Bob     | IT         |
     | Charlie | IT         |

### Final Result Set:

| name    | department |
|---------|------------|
| Alice   | HR         |
| Bob     | IT         |
| Charlie | IT         |

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Sorting and hashing both consume memory. Large result sets can impact performance and resource usage.
- **Execution Time**: Sorting generally has O(n log n) complexity, whereas hashing can have O(n) complexity in ideal conditions.
- **Indexes**: Proper indexing can improve the performance of `DISTINCT` operations by speeding up the sorting process.

Understanding these details helps in optimizing queries and anticipating the performance implications of using `DISTINCT` in SQL.
