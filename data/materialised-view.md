### Materialized View

Definition:
- A database object containing the results of a query stored physically.
- Provides faster access to precomputed data.

### Key Features

1. Stored Results:
   - Results of the query are stored in the database.
   - Significantly improves query performance for complex and time-consuming queries.

2. Refresh Mechanism:
   - Needs periodic refreshing to stay up-to-date with the underlying data.
   - Refreshes can be automatic, on-demand, or incremental.

3. Indexing:
   - Can be indexed to improve query performance.
   - Indexes speed up access to the stored data.

4. Storage:
   - Consumes storage space in the database.
   - Storage requirement depends on the size of the query result and any additional indexes.

### Use Cases

1. Data Warehousing:
   - Precompute and store aggregated data.
   - Reduces time for generating reports and performing analytics.

2. Complex Queries:
   - Benefits queries involving complex joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
   - Faster subsequent access to stored results.

3. Read-Intensive Applications:
   - Ideal for applications with frequent read operations and infrequent updates.
   - Ensures fast data access without recomputation.

### Refresh Strategies

1. Complete Refresh:
   - Recomputes the entire query.
   - Replaces the contents of the materialized view.
   - Suitable for significant changes in underlying data.

2. Fast Refresh (Incremental Refresh):
   - Applies only changes since the last refresh.
   - Requires maintaining additional metadata (e.g., materialized view logs).
   - Suitable for small, frequent changes in underlying data.

3. On-Demand Refresh:
   - Manually refreshed by the user.
   - Provides control over refresh timing.
   - Useful for managing refresh operation performance.

4. Periodic Refresh:
   - Automatically refreshed at specified intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).
   - Suitable for predictable changes in underlying data.

### Example in SQL

1. Creating a Materialized View:
   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW total_sales_by_product
   BUILD IMMEDIATE
   REFRESH FAST ON COMMIT
   AS
   SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY product_id;
   ```
   - BUILD IMMEDIATE: Populates immediately upon creation.
   - REFRESH FAST ON COMMIT: Incrementally refreshed after every transaction commit.

2. Manually Refreshing:
   ```sql
   EXEC DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('total_sales_by_product');
   ```

3. Querying:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM total_sales_by_product WHERE total_sales > 1000;
   ```

### Advantages

1. Performance Improvement:
   - Faster query response by storing precomputed results.
   - Reduces the need for repeated complex query computation.

2. Efficiency:
   - Reduces load on underlying tables in read-heavy applications.
   - Offloads complex query processing to the materialized view.

3. Flexibility:
   - Supports various refresh strategies for balancing data freshness and performance.
   - Can be indexed to enhance performance further.

### Disadvantages

1. Storage Overhead:
   - Requires additional storage space for materialized results.
   - Storage increases with the size of the result and indexes.

2. Maintenance:
   - Requires periodic refresh to maintain data accuracy.
   - Incremental refresh needs materialized view logs, adding storage and processing overhead.

3. Complexity:
   - Managing refresh strategies and consistency adds complexity.
   - Requires careful planning and understanding of data access patterns.

### Conclusion
- Materialized Views:
  - Optimize query performance in complex queries, data warehousing, and read-intensive applications.
  - Offer faster access by storing precomputed results.
  - Require careful planning for storage, maintenance, and complexity management.
