## Explain delta lake on S3

Delta Lake on S3:

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. It is designed to work on top of existing data lakes, providing features like schema enforcement, versioning, and time travel. When integrated with Amazon S3, Delta Lake allows you to manage data lakes with robust transactional capabilities, ensuring data reliability and consistency.

### Key Features of Delta Lake on S3:

1. ACID Transactions:
   - Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none are applied.
   - Consistency: Guarantees that the data lake transitions from one consistent state to another.
   - Isolation: Provides snapshot isolation, allowing concurrent reads and writes without conflicts.
   - Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is durable and preserved in S3.

2. Schema Enforcement and Evolution:
   - Schema Enforcement: Prevents the writing of data that does not conform to the defined schema, ensuring data quality.
   - Schema Evolution: Allows changes to the schema over time, such as adding new columns, without breaking existing queries.

3. Time Travel:
   - Enables you to query previous versions of the data, allowing you to easily access historical data or rollback to a previous state.

4. Scalability and Performance:
   - Optimizes storage and query performance by using features like data skipping, Z-order indexing, and file compaction.

5. Interoperability:
   - Seamlessly integrates with Apache Spark, providing an easy upgrade path for existing Spark applications.

### How Delta Lake Works on S3:

1. Data Storage and Metadata:

   1.1 Storage:
      - Data is stored in S3 in Parquet format, partitioned for efficient access and retrieval.
      - Delta Lake maintains a transaction log in S3 that records all changes to the data.

   1.2 Transaction Log:
      - The transaction log (Delta Log) is a sequence of JSON files that record metadata about each transaction, ensuring ACID properties.
      - This log is stored in the same S3 bucket as the data, typically in a `_delta_log` directory.

2. Data Operations:

   2.1 Writing Data:
      - When writing data to Delta Lake on S3, Delta Lake ensures that all write operations are atomic and follow the defined schema.
      - Delta Lake manages the transaction log to record the changes and make them consistent.

   2.2 Reading Data:
      - When querying data, Delta Lake reads the transaction log to determine the current state of the data.
      - It applies any necessary changes and filters out deleted or updated records, presenting a consistent view.

3. Time Travel and Versioning:

   3.1 Versioning:
      - Each commit in Delta Lake is versioned, allowing you to access data as it was at any point in time.
      - You can query historical data using the version number or timestamp.

   3.2 Time Travel:
      - Delta Lake provides the ability to query previous versions of the data using SQL or DataFrame API.
      - Example: `df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 5).load("s3a://my-delta-table")`

### Setting Up Delta Lake on S3:

   - Use Delta Lake's capabilities to update or delete data.

   ```python
   from delta.tables import DeltaTable

   delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "s3a://my-delta-table")
   delta_table.update(
       condition = "id % 2 == 0",
       set = { "id": "id + 100" }
   )
   ```

6. Time Travel Queries:
   - Query historical data by version or timestamp.

   ```python
   df_version = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 0).load("s3a://my-delta-table")
   df_version.show()
   ```

### Best Practices:

1. Optimize File Sizes:
   - Periodically compact small files into larger files to improve query performance.

   ```python
   delta_table.optimize().executeCompaction()
   ```

2. Use Data Partitioning:
   - Partition data by key attributes to reduce the amount of data scanned during queries.

   ```python
   data.write.partitionBy("date").format("delta").save("s3a://my-delta-table")
   ```

3. Regularly Vacuum Old Data:
   - Remove old data files that are no longer needed to free up storage space.

   ```python
   delta_table.vacuum(7)  # Retains last 7 days of data
   ```
