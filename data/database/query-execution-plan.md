## How to Read a Query Execution Plan in Detail

A query execution plan is a critical tool for understanding how a database engine processes a query. It provides a roadmap of the steps taken by the database to execute a query, highlighting areas that may need optimization. Understanding how to read and interpret these plans is essential for database performance tuning.

### Key Concepts in Query Execution Plans

1. **Execution Plan Types**
2. **Plan Operators**
3. **Cost Metrics**
4. **Execution Order**
5. **Row Estimates**
6. **Physical and Logical Operations**

### 1. Execution Plan Types

There are two main types of execution plans:
- **Estimated Execution Plan**: Generated without executing the query, it shows what the database engine expects to do.
- **Actual Execution Plan**: Generated after executing the query, it shows what actually happened, including runtime metrics.

### 2. Plan Operators

Plan operators are the building blocks of an execution plan. Each operator represents a specific action, such as scanning a table, filtering rows, or joining tables. Common operators include:

- **Table Scan / Index Scan**: Reads all rows in a table or index.
- **Index Seek**: Efficiently retrieves rows from an index based on a predicate.
- **Nested Loops Join**: Joins tables by iterating over each row from the outer table and finding matching rows in the inner table.
- **Hash Join**: Joins tables by hashing join keys.
- **Merge Join**: Joins sorted input tables by merging them.
- **Filter**: Applies a predicate to filter rows.
- **Sort**: Orders rows based on specified columns.

### 3. Cost Metrics

Cost metrics provide a way to estimate the resource usage of different operations in the plan. Common metrics include:

- **Cost**: An arbitrary value representing the relative expense of an operation.
- **CPU Cost**: The estimated amount of CPU time required.
- **I/O Cost**: The estimated amount of disk I/O required.
- **Memory Cost**: The estimated amount of memory required.

### 4. Execution Order

The execution order of plan operators is critical for understanding the flow of the query. While the plan might be presented in a tree-like structure, the actual execution order can differ. The database engine typically executes the plan from the bottom up.

### 5. Row Estimates

Row estimates provide an estimate of the number of rows processed by each operator. This information helps identify discrepancies between expected and actual row counts, which can indicate problems with statistics or cardinality estimation.

### 6. Physical and Logical Operations

- **Logical Operations**: Describe the abstract operations required to execute the query (e.g., filter, join, project).
- **Physical Operations**: Describe the actual implementations of the logical operations (e.g., index seek, hash join).

### Reading an Execution Plan: Step-by-Step

#### Example Query

Consider the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000
ORDER BY e.name;
```

#### Generating an Execution Plan

In SQL Server, you can generate an estimated execution plan with:
```sql
SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON;
GO
-- Your query here
GO
SET SHOWPLAN_XML OFF;
GO
```

For an actual execution plan:
```sql
SET STATISTICS XML ON;
GO
-- Your query here
GO
SET STATISTICS XML OFF;
GO
```

In PostgreSQL, use the `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` commands:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000
ORDER BY e.name;
```

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000
ORDER BY e.name;
```

### Interpreting the Execution Plan

#### 1. Identify the Plan Root

The root of the plan is usually the last operation to be executed, typically something like `SELECT` or `RETURN`.

#### 2. Understand the Data Access Methods

Look for how data is accessed:
- **Table Scan**: Full scan of the table, which can be expensive.
- **Index Scan/Seek**: More efficient if an index is used to access the data.

#### 3. Examine Join Operations

Check how tables are joined:
- **Nested Loop**: Good for small datasets or indexed joins.
- **Hash Join**: Useful for larger datasets without indexes on the join columns.
- **Merge Join**: Efficient for pre-sorted data.

#### 4. Evaluate Filter Operations

Identify filters applied to reduce the number of rows:
- Look for `Filter` or `WHERE` conditions.
- Ensure filters are applied as early as possible to minimize the amount of data processed.

#### 5. Check Sorting and Aggregation

Look for sorting and aggregation operations:
- **Sort**: Expensive, especially if there is no index to support the order.
- **Aggregation**: Operations like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`.

### Example Analysis

Consider the following simplified execution plan for the example query:

```
Sort (cost=200.00..210.00 rows=1000 width=50)
  -> Hash Join (cost=150.00..180.00 rows=1000 width=50)
       Hash Cond: (e.department_id = d.department_id)
       -> Seq Scan on employees e (cost=100.00..120.00 rows=500 width=25)
            Filter: (e.salary > 50000)
       -> Hash (cost=50.00..50.00 rows=1000 width=25)
            -> Seq Scan on departments d (cost=0.00..50.00 rows=1000 width=25)
```

### Step-by-Step Interpretation

1. **Sort Operation**:
   - The root operation is a `Sort`, indicating the final result set is ordered by `e.name`.
   - Cost: 200.00 to 210.00

2. **Hash Join Operation**:
   - Joins `employees` and `departments` tables using a hash join.
   - Cost: 150.00 to 180.00
   - Join condition: `e.department_id = d.department_id`

3. **Sequential Scan on Employees**:
   - Scans the `employees` table.
   - Cost: 100.00 to 120.00
   - Filter: `e.salary > 50000`

4. **Hash Operation**:
   - Builds a hash table for the `departments` table.
   - Cost: 50.00
   - Sequential scan on `departments` with a cost of 0.00 to 50.00

### Optimization Tips

1. **Indexes**:
   - Ensure indexes on `department_id` in both tables to optimize joins.
   - Index on `salary` to speed up the filter operation.

2. **Query Rewrite**:
   - Simplify the query to minimize complex operations if possible.
   - Use indexed views if applicable.

3. **Statistics**:
   - Ensure up-to-date statistics for accurate cost estimation and better optimization.

### Conclusion

Reading and interpreting query execution plans involves understanding the sequence of operations performed by the database engine, evaluating cost metrics, and identifying potential optimization opportunities. By mastering these concepts, you can significantly improve query performance and overall database efficiency.

## Data serialisation, CPU time and wait time

### Data Serialization

#### Definition
Data serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and later reconstructed. In the context of databases and query execution, serialization is crucial for sending data between different components of a distributed system or for persisting data to disk.

#### Common Serialization Formats
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**
- **Protobuf (Protocol Buffers)**
- **Avro**

#### Use Cases in Databases
1. **Data Transfer**: Moving data between client and server, or between different servers.
2. **Caching**: Storing objects in a cache in a serialized form.
3. **Logging**: Persisting objects in logs for auditing and debugging.
4. **Persistence**: Storing objects in databases or file systems.

#### Example
When a query result set is sent from a database server to a client application, it may be serialized into JSON format:
```json
[
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
]
```

### CPU Time in Query Execution Plan

#### Definition
CPU time in a query execution plan refers to the amount of time the processor spends executing the instructions of the query. It includes time spent on:
- Parsing the query
- Optimizing the query
- Executing the operations required to fulfill the query (e.g., joins, aggregations)

#### Importance
- **Performance Analysis**: High CPU time can indicate that the query is complex or inefficient.
- **Resource Management**: Helps in understanding the load on the CPU and planning resource allocation.
- **Optimization**: Identifying operations that consume significant CPU time can guide efforts to optimize queries.

#### Example
In a SQL query execution plan, you might see something like:
```
Node Type: Aggregate
  CPU Time: 25ms
  Details: ...
```
This indicates that the aggregate operation took 25 milliseconds of CPU time.

### Waiting Time in Query Execution Plan

#### Definition
Waiting time, also known as wait time, in a query execution plan refers to the time spent waiting for resources to become available. This can include waiting for:
- I/O operations to complete (e.g., reading data from disk)
- Locks to be released by other transactions
- Network latency in distributed systems

#### Importance
- **Bottleneck Identification**: High waiting times can indicate resource contention or I/O bottlenecks.
- **Concurrency Management**: Helps in understanding the impact of concurrent transactions on query performance.
- **System Tuning**: Provides insights for tuning the system to reduce wait times, such as optimizing disk I/O, improving indexing, or reducing lock contention.

#### Example
In a SQL query execution plan, you might see something like:
```
Node Type: Index Scan
  Waiting Time: 45ms
  Details: ...
```
This indicates that the index scan operation spent 45 milliseconds waiting for resources.

### Understanding the Execution Plan

A query execution plan is a detailed map of how a database engine executes a query. It includes information about various operations involved in query execution, such as joins, scans, aggregations, and sorts. It also provides metrics like CPU time, waiting time, and memory usage, which are crucial for performance analysis and optimization.

#### Components of an Execution Plan

1. **Operation Nodes**: Represent different operations like scans, joins, sorts, etc.
2. **Cost Metrics**: Include CPU time, waiting time, and I/O operations.
3. **Row Estimates**: Number of rows processed at each stage.
4. **Order of Execution**: The sequence in which operations are performed.

#### Example of an Execution Plan

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT customer.name, SUM(order.amount)
FROM customer
JOIN order ON customer.id = order.customer_id
GROUP BY customer.name;
```

Example Execution Plan:
```
HashAggregate (cost=500.75..502.75 rows=100 width=48) (actual time=40.905..40.913 rows=100 loops=1)
  Group Key: customer.name
  ->  Hash Join (cost=200.50..480.25 rows=5000 width=48) (actual time=10.605..30.403 rows=5000 loops=1)
        Hash Cond: (order.customer_id = customer.id)
        ->  Seq Scan on order (cost=0.00..150.00 rows=10000 width=20) (actual time=0.007..10.007 rows=10000 loops=1)
        ->  Hash (cost=150.00..150.00 rows=5000 width=20) (actual time=10.581..10.581 rows=5000 loops=1)
              ->  Seq Scan on customer (cost=0.00..150.00 rows=5000 width=20) (actual time=0.005..5.005 rows=5000 loops=1)
Planning Time: 1.123 ms
Execution Time: 42.543 ms
```

In this plan:
- **HashAggregate** node has a cost and actual time metrics.
- **Hash Join** operation has both CPU time (actual time) and the number of rows processed.
- **Seq Scan** on `order` and `customer` tables shows the actual time taken and the number of rows scanned.

### Conclusion

Understanding data serialization, CPU time, and waiting time in query execution plans is essential for optimizing database performance. Serialization facilitates efficient data transfer and storage, CPU time highlights computational costs, and waiting time reveals resource contention. Together, these metrics help identify performance bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts, ensuring efficient query execution and better resource utilization.


## Effective and Execution Time

In the context of databases, effective time and execution time are important metrics for understanding and optimizing query performance. Here’s a detailed explanation of both:

### Effective Time

**Effective time** in databases refers to the actual time the database engine spends processing a query. This includes the time spent on:

- Parsing the query.
- Optimizing the query plan.
- Executing the query plan.
- Fetching the required data.

Effective time focuses solely on the periods during which the database is actively working on the query, excluding any idle times, network delays, or waiting for locks or resources.

### Execution Time

**Execution time** in databases refers to the total time from the moment a query is submitted to the moment the final result is returned to the user. This includes:

- Effective time (all the time the database actively processes the query).
- Any waiting time for locks or resources.
- Network latency (time taken for the query to travel across the network to the database server and for the results to travel back).
- Time spent in queue (if the database server is handling multiple queries simultaneously).
- Disk I/O time (time spent reading from or writing to disk).

Execution time is a more comprehensive measure, encompassing the entire duration of the query lifecycle, including both productive and non-productive periods.

### Summary

- **Effective Time:** Measures only the time spent by the database actively processing the query.
- **Execution Time:** Measures the total time from query submission to result delivery, including all delays and waiting periods.

Understanding both metrics helps in identifying bottlenecks and improving database performance. For example, if the execution time is significantly longer than the effective time, it may indicate issues like network latency, resource contention, or inefficient indexing.
