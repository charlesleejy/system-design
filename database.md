ACID Properties in Database Management

ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are fundamental principles to ensure reliable transaction processing in database systems.

1. Atomicity
- Definition: Ensures each transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit.
- Outcome: The transaction either completes fully or fails completely.
- Example: In a fund transfer, debiting one account and crediting another must both succeed or both fail.

2. Consistency
- Definition: Ensures a transaction moves the database from one valid state to another.
- Outcome: Maintains data integrity by enforcing rules and constraints.
- Example: A transaction cannot result in a negative account balance if the database rule prevents it.

3. Isolation
- Definition: Controls how the transaction is visible to other concurrent transactions.
- Outcome: Provides the illusion that transactions are executed sequentially.
- Levels:
- Read Uncommitted: Lowest isolation, allowing "dirty reads."
- Read Committed: Prevents "dirty reads," but allows "non-repeatable reads."
- Repeatable Read: Prevents "dirty" and "non-repeatable reads."
- Serializable: Highest isolation, preventing all anomalies but may reduce performance.
- Example: Higher isolation prevents anomalies like "dirty reads" or "phantom reads."

4. Durability
- Definition: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent.
- Outcome: Data survives power loss, crashes, or errors.
- Techniques: Uses non-volatile memory to ensure permanence.
- Example: Committed transaction data remains intact even after a system crash.

Importance of ACID Properties
- Reliability: Ensures the database remains accurate and reliable.
- Data Integrity: Critical for applications where correctness is paramount (e.g., financial systems).
- Robustness: Provides fault tolerance and consistency.

Summary
- Atomicity: All-or-nothing transactions.
- Consistency: Valid state transitions.
- Isolation: Controlled visibility of transactions.
- Durability: Permanent data storage post-commit.

These properties are essential for traditional relational databases, ensuring robustness and reliability, while some NoSQL databases may relax these properties for flexibility and performance.
