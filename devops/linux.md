2. **Multiuser Capability**:
   - Linux supports multiple users simultaneously, allowing different users to access and use system resources without interfering with each other.

3. **Multitasking**:
   - Linux efficiently handles multiple processes simultaneously, enabling smooth operation of various applications.

4. **Portability**:
   - Linux can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms, from personal computers and servers to embedded systems and mobile devices.

5. **Security**:
   - Linux incorporates robust security features, including user permissions, file system permissions, and powerful security modules like SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux).

6. **Stability and Performance**:
   - Linux is known for its stability and performance, making it an ideal choice for servers and critical applications.

7. **Customization**:
   - Linux offers extensive customization options, from the kernel to the user interface. Users can tailor the system to meet their specific needs.

8. **Compatibility**:
   - Linux supports a wide range of file systems, software, and networking protocols, ensuring compatibility with various applications and devices.

### Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution (distro) is an operating system made from a software collection, which includes the Linux kernel, package management system, and a set of default applications. Popular distributions include:

1. **Ubuntu**:
   - User-friendly and popular among beginners. Based on Debian, it provides regular updates and long-term support (LTS) versions.

2. **Debian**:
   - Known for its stability and vast software repository. It is the base for many other distributions, including Ubuntu.

3. **Fedora**:
   - Sponsored by Red Hat, it focuses on innovation and integration of the latest technologies.

4. **CentOS**:
   - A free alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), commonly used for servers due to its stability and support.

5. **Arch Linux**:
   - A lightweight and flexible distribution aimed at experienced users. It follows a rolling release model.

6. **openSUSE**:
   - Known for its powerful YaST configuration tool and a choice between stable and rolling release versions.

7. **Mint**:
   - Based on Ubuntu, it aims to provide a more complete out-of-the-box experience by including additional software and media codecs.

### Linux File System Hierarchy

Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure with a single root directory (`/`). Some key directories include:

- `/bin`: Essential binary executables.
- `/boot`: Boot loader files.
- `/dev`: Device files.
- `/etc`: System configuration files.
- `/home`: User home directories.
- `/lib`: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.
- `/media`: Mount points for removable media.
- `/mnt`: Temporary mount points.
- `/opt`: Optional software packages.
- `/proc`: Virtual filesystem for process and kernel information.
- `/root`: Home directory for the root user.
- `/sbin`: System binaries.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files.
- `/usr`: User utilities and applications.
- `/var`: Variable data files like logs and databases.

### Basic Linux Commands

   - `cp`: Copy files or directories.
   - `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
   - `touch`: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.

2. **File Viewing and Editing**:
   - `cat`: Concatenate and display file content.
   - `less`: View file content with paging.
   - `nano`: Simple text editor.
   - `vim`: Advanced text editor.

3. **Permissions and Ownership**:
   - `chmod`: Change file permissions.
   - `chown`: Change file owner and group.
   - `chgrp`: Change group ownership of files.

4. **Process Management**:
   - `ps`: Display currently running processes.
   - `top`: Real-time process monitoring.
   - `kill`: Terminate a process by PID.
   - `killall`: Terminate processes by name.

5. **Networking**:
   - `ping`: Test network connectivity.
   - `ifconfig`: Display or configure network interfaces.
   - `netstat`: Network statistics.
   - `ssh`: Secure shell for remote login.
   - `scp`: Secure copy files between hosts.

6. **Package Management**:
   - **Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu)**:
     - `apt-get`: Advanced Package Tool for handling packages.
     - `dpkg`: Debian package manager.
   - **Red Hat-based systems (e.g., Fedora, CentOS)**:
     - `yum`: Yellowdog Updater Modified.
     - `dnf`: Dandified Yum (newer package manager).
     - `rpm`: Red Hat Package Manager.

7. **System Information**:
   - `uname -a`: Display system information.
   - `df -h`: Show disk space usage.
   - `du -sh`: Display directory size.
   - `free -m`: Show memory usage.
   - `uptime`: Display system uptime.

### System Administration

1. **User Management**:
   - `adduser`: Add a new user.
   - `usermod`: Modify a user account.
