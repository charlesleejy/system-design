Design a Rate Limiter

Purpose of a Rate Limiter:

- Controls the rate of traffic from a client/service.
- Prevents excessive requests, blocking those beyond a threshold.
- Examples:
    - Write max 2 posts/second.
    - Create max 10 accounts/day from the same IP.
    - Claim rewards max 5 times/week from the same device.
    
Benefits of Using an API Rate Limiter:

- Prevents resource starvation caused by Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Reduces costs by limiting excessive requests and allocating resources to high-priority APIs.
- Prevents server overload by filtering excess requests.

Understanding the Problem and Design Scope:

- Server-side API Rate Limiter: Focuses on server-side implementation.
- Throttle Rules: Supports different sets of rules based on IP, user ID, etc.
- Large Scale: Designed to handle a large number of requests.
- Distributed Environment: Should work across multiple servers.
- Implementation Choice: Can be a separate service or part of application code.
- User Notification: Informs users when they are throttled.

Requirements:

- Accurately limit excessive requests.
- Low latency to not slow down HTTP response time.
- Use minimal memory.
- Support distributed rate limiting.
- Clear exception handling for throttled requests.
- High fault tolerance to not affect the entire system if issues arise.

High-Level Design:

- Server-side Implementation: More reliable than client-side.
    - client requests can easily be forged by malicious actors. 
    - might not have control over the client implementation.
- Middleware: Throttles requests before reaching API servers.
- API Gateway: Often used in microservices for rate limiting and other functions (e.g., SSL termination, authentication).

Rate Limiting Algorithms:

- Token Bucket:
    - Predefined capacity; tokens added at set rates.
    - Requests consume tokens; excess requests are dropped.
    - Pros: Easy to implement, memory efficient, allows traffic bursts.
    - Cons: Challenging to tune parameters (bucket size, refill rate).

- Leaking Bucket:
    - Processes requests at a fixed rate using a FIFO queue.
    - Pros: Memory efficient, stable outflow rate.
    - Cons: Burst traffic fills queue with old requests, making recent requests wait.

- Fixed Window Counter:
    - Divides timeline into fixed windows with a counter.
    - Pros: Memory efficient, easy to understand.
    - Cons: Traffic spikes at window edges can exceed limits.

- Sliding Window Log:
    - Keeps track of request timestamps.
    - Pros: Accurate rate limiting.
    - Cons: High memory usage due to stored timestamps.

- Sliding Window Counter:
    - Combines fixed window counter and sliding window log.
    - Pros: Smooths out traffic spikes, memory efficient.
    - Cons: Approximate rate limiting, assumes even request distribution.

High-Level Architecture:
- Counters in In-Memory Cache: Fast access, supports expiration.
- Redis: Popular choice with commands INCR (increment counter) and EXPIRE (set timeout).

Detailed Design:
- Rate Limiting Rules: Stored on disk, loaded into cache by workers.

Request Handling:
- Middleware checks counters and rules from Redis.
- If limit not reached, request proceeds; otherwise, returns 429 error.

Rate Limiter in Distributed Environment:
- Race Condition: Use Lua scripts or Redis sorted sets to handle concurrent requests.
- Synchronization: Centralized data stores like Redis ensure consistency across multiple servers.

Performance Optimization:

- Multi-Data Center Setup: Reduces latency by routing traffic to nearest edge server.
- Eventual Consistency Model: Synchronizes data with eventual consistency for high performance.

Monitoring:

- Analytics Data: Ensure rate limiting and rules are effective.
- Adjust Rules: Relax or tighten rules based on traffic patterns and effectiveness.

Additional Considerations:

- Hard vs. Soft Rate Limiting: Strict (hard) vs. flexible (soft) thresholds.
- Rate Limiting at Different Levels: Application (HTTP) level, network (IP) level, etc.
- Client Best Practices: Use caching, understand limits, handle exceptions, and implement retry logic.

Summary
- Implement rate limiting to control traffic and prevent system overload.
- Choose appropriate algorithm based on use case and requirements.
- Design system for scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
- Monitor and adjust rate limiting rules based on real-world usage.
