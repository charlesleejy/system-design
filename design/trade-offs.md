Top System Design Trade-Offs

Scalability vs. Performance

- Scalability: Ability to grow to handle more work.
- Performance: Speed of completing tasks.

Trade-off: Adding machines improves scalability but may introduce delays, impacting performance. Optimizing for performance might hinder scalability.

Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling

- Vertical Scaling: Adding resources (CPU, RAM) to existing servers.
- Horizontal Scaling: Adding more servers.

Trade-off: Vertical scaling is simpler but limited by hardware; introduces a single point of failure. Horizontal scaling offers limitless growth but increases management complexity.

Latency vs. Throughput

- Latency: Time taken for data to transfer.
- Throughput: Volume of data processed over time.

Trade-off: Low latency is crucial for real-time applications; high throughput is essential for data-intensive applications.

SQL vs NoSQL Databases

- SQL: Structured, powerful queries, ACID transactions, harder to scale horizontally (e.g., MySQL).
- NoSQL: Flexible, easily scalable, sacrifices ACID transactions (e.g., Cassandra).

Trade-off: SQL is ideal for complex queries and transactional data; NoSQL suits large volumes of unstructured data.

Consistency vs. Availability (CAP Theorem)

- Consistency: Always get the most recent data.
- Availability: System remains operational even with some failures.

Trade-off: Distributed systems can only guarantee two out of three: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.

Strong vs Eventual Consistency

- Strong Consistency: Immediate visibility of data updates.
- Eventual Consistency: Updates may not be immediately visible, but will eventually be consistent.

Trade-off: Strong consistency ensures immediate accuracy; eventual consistency offers better performance and availability.

Read-Through vs Write-Through Cache

- Read-Through Cache: Checks cache first; if miss, fetches from primary storage.
- Write-Through Cache: Simultaneously writes to cache and primary storage.

Trade-off: Read-through is beneficial for read-heavy applications; write-through for write-heavy applications ensuring up-to-date data.

Batch vs Stream Processing

- Batch Processing: Processes data in large batches.
- Stream Processing: Processes data in real-time.

Trade-off: Batch is suited for non-time-sensitive data; stream is essential for real-time data processing.

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing

- Synchronous: Tasks performed one after another, waiting for outcomes.
- Asynchronous: Tasks run in the background without waiting.

Trade-off: Synchronous ensures order and dependency; asynchronous improves efficiency and responsiveness.

Stateful vs Stateless Architecture

- Stateful: Remembers past interactions (session continuity).
- Stateless: No memory of past interactions (each request is new).

Trade-off: Stateful provides continuity; stateless is simpler and more scalable.

Long Polling vs WebSockets

- Long Polling: Client repeatedly requests data until new info is available.
- WebSockets: Persistent connection for real-time data exchange.

Trade-off: Long polling is simpler but less efficient; WebSockets offer real-time communication but are more complex.

Normalization vs Denormalization

- Normalization: Splits data into related tables to reduce redundancy.
- Denormalization: Combines data into fewer tables for query performance.

Trade-off: Normalization improves data integrity; denormalization speeds up queries at the cost of redundancy.

Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

- Monolithic: Single unified codebase.
- Microservices: Smaller, independently deployable services.

Trade-off: Monolithic is simpler and easier to deploy; microservices improve scalability and development speed but increase complexity.

REST vs GraphQL

- REST: Simplicity and multiple format support.
- GraphQL: Efficient data fetching with fewer requests.

Trade-off: REST is easy to use and widely adopted; GraphQL is more efficient but requires more upfront design and complexity.

TCP vs UDP

- TCP: Reliable, ordered delivery of data.
- UDP: Fast, unordered delivery.

Trade-off: TCP is essential for reliability (e.g., email); UDP prioritizes speed for time-sensitive applications (e.g., video streaming).
