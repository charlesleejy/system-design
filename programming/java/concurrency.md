## Multi-threading in Java

Multithreading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more threads, making optimal use of the available CPU resources. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to implement and run multithreading in Java:

### 1. Understanding Threads in Java

- Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled for execution. Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming through the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.util.concurrent` package.
- Runnable Interface: This interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called `run`.

### 2. Creating Threads in Java

There are two primary ways to create and run threads in Java:

#### Method 1: Extending the `Thread` Class

1. Create a new class that extends `Thread`:
2. Override the `run` method:
3. Create an instance of the class and call `start` to begin execution:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Value: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Method 2: Implementing the `Runnable` Interface

1. Create a new class that implements `Runnable`:
2. Override the `run` method:
3. Create an instance of `Thread`, passing an instance of the class to the constructor, and call `start`:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Value: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### 3. Thread Lifecycle

- New: A thread that is newly created but not yet started.
- Runnable: A thread that is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
- Running: A thread that is currently executing.
- Blocked: A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
- Waiting: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
- Timed Waiting: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action within a specified waiting time.
- Terminated: A thread that has completed its execution or has been terminated.

### 4. Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is required to avoid data inconsistency. Java provides several mechanisms for synchronization:

#### Synchronized Method

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

#### Synchronized Block

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

### 5. Java Concurrency Utilities

Java provides high-level concurrency utilities in the `java.util.concurrent` package to simplify working with threads.

#### Executor Framework

The Executor framework provides a higher-level replacement for working with threads directly.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Task 1 - Value: " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println(e);
                }
            }
        };

        Runnable task2 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Task 2 - Value: " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println(e);
                }
            }
        };

        executor.submit(task1);
        executor.submit(task2);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### 6. Advanced Synchronization Utilities

Java provides several advanced synchronization utilities in the `java.util.concurrent` package:

#### CountDownLatch

A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Task started");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Task completed");
            latch.countDown();
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            new Thread(task).start();
        }

        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("All tasks are completed.");
    }
}
```

#### CyclicBarrier

A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> {
            System.out.println("All parties have reached the barrier.");
        });

        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Task started");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                barrier.await();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Task completed");
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            new Thread(task).start();
        }
    }
}
```
