## URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and a URL (Uniform Resource Locator

A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) are both used to identify resources on the internet, but they serve slightly different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the differences between a URI and a URL:

### Definition

URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):
- A URI is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet. 
- It can identify a resource by either its location, name, or both.
- URIs encompass both URLs and URNs.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
- A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate a resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network location).
- It specifies how to access the resource, typically by providing a scheme (protocol), a host, and a path.

### Components

URI:
- Scheme: Specifies the protocol or mechanism used to access the resource (e.g., `http`, `ftp`, `mailto`).
- Authority: Includes the user information, host, and port (optional).
- Path: Specifies the location of the resource within the host.
- Query: Provides additional parameters (optional).
- Fragment: Identifies a secondary resource or part of the primary resource (optional).

URL:
- Scheme: Specifies the protocol (e.g., `http`, `https`, `ftp`).
- Host: Specifies the domain name or IP address.
- Port: Specifies the port number (optional).
- Path: Specifies the specific resource within the host.
- Query: Provides additional parameters (optional).
- Fragment: Identifies a part of the resource (optional).

### Examples

URI Examples:
- `http://www.example.com/resource?id=123#section2`
  - Scheme: `http`
  - Host: `www.example.com`
  - Path: `/resource`
  - Query: `id=123`
  - Fragment: `section2`
- `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0`
  - Scheme: `urn`
  - Namespace Identifier: `isbn`
  - Namespace Specific String: `978-3-16-148410-0`

URL Examples:
- `http://www.example.com/resource`
  - Scheme: `http`
  - Host: `www.example.com`
  - Path: `/resource`
- `ftp://ftp.example.com/file.txt`
  - Scheme: `ftp`
  - Host: `ftp.example.com`
  - Path: `/file.txt`

### Key Differences

1. Purpose:
   - URI: A broader concept that can identify a resource by name, location, or both.
   - URL: A subset of URI that specifically provides the location and means to access a resource.

2. Scope:
   - URI: Includes URLs and URNs (Uniform Resource Names).
   - URL: Includes only those URIs that provide location information.

3. Use Cases:
   - URI: Can be used to identify any type of resource, including those that are not accessible over the internet (e.g., ISBN for books).
   - URL: Used specifically to locate resources on the internet, such as web pages, images, and files.

4. Identification vs. Location:
   - URI: Can identify a resource by either its location or its name (or both).
   - URL: Always identifies a resource by its location.

### Conclusion

While all URLs are URIs, not all URIs are URLs. A URI is a generic identifier for a resource, which can be either a URL (specifying how to access the resource) or a URN (specifying the resource by name). Understanding the distinction between URI and URL is important for correctly identifying and accessing resources on the internet.
