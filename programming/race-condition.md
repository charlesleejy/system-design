## Race Condition

A race condition occurs when the behavior of software depends on the timing or sequence of uncontrollable events, such as the order in which multiple threads or processes execute. This typically happens in concurrent systems where multiple threads or processes access and modify shared resources simultaneously, leading to unpredictable outcomes and potential data corruption.

### Key Points:
- Concurrency: Multiple operations happening at the same time.
- Shared Resources: Data or resources accessed by multiple threads/processes.
- Critical Section: Code section accessing shared resources.

### Problems:
- Inconsistent State: Unpredictable behavior due to unsynchronized access.
- Data Corruption: Simultaneous modifications causing incorrect data.
- Security Vulnerabilities: Exploitable gaps due to timing issues.

### Prevention Techniques:
- Locks (Mutexes): Ensure one thread/process accesses the critical section at a time.
- Semaphores: Control access to resources by multiple threads/processes.
- Atomic Operations: Ensure indivisible operations on shared data.
- Thread-Local Storage: Provide each thread with its own data copy.
- Transactions: Ensure atomicity and consistency in database operations.

By using proper synchronization mechanisms and designing systems to manage concurrent access, race conditions can be avoided, ensuring data integrity and system reliability.
