Scalability

Definition: The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of load by adding resources.
Importance: Ensures system performance remains robust as usage grows.


Ways a System Can Grow

User Base Growth: Increased number of users and requests.
Example: Social media platform surge in users.

Feature Growth: New functionalities expanding system capabilities.
Example: E-commerce website adding new payment methods.

Data Volume Growth: Increase in stored and managed data.
Example: Video streaming platform storing more content.

Complexity Growth: Evolving architecture with more components.
Example: Simple application evolving into microservices.

Geographic Reach Growth: Serving users in new regions/countries.
Example: E-commerce expanding internationally.


How to Scale a System

Vertical Scaling (Scale up): Adding more power (RAM, CPU) to existing machines.

Horizontal Scaling (Scale out): Adding more machines to distribute workload.
Example: Netflix adding servers for streaming service.

Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to avoid overload.
Example: Google distributing search queries.

Caching: Storing frequently accessed data in-memory to improve response times.
Example: Reddit caching hot posts and comments.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Distributing static assets closer to users.
Example: Cloudflare caching content globally.

Partitioning: Splitting data/functionality across multiple nodes/servers.
Example: Amazon DynamoDB distributing data and traffic.

Asynchronous Communication: Using background queues/message brokers for non-critical tasks.
Example: Slack processing messages asynchronously.

Microservices Architecture: Breaking down application into smaller, independent services.
Example: Uber using microservices for different functions.

Auto-Scaling: Automatically adjusting server count based on load.
Example: AWS Auto Scaling adjusting capacity automatically.

Multi-region Deployment: Deploying application in multiple data centers/cloud regions.
Example: Spotify ensuring availability with multi-region deployments.
